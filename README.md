# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project is used to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in a highly imbalanced dataset. We use SMOTE for oversampling and evaluating three machine learning modelsâ€”Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Performance is analyzed through precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC metrics.
