Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

Project Description
This project is used to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset using machine learning techniques learned. The dataset in use is highly imbalanced. 

Key instructions to Replicate the Project:
-The address of the dataset should be placed in Line 23 of the code :df = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv') #REPLACE WITH YOUR FILE PATH
-Or use df = pd.read_csv('creditcard.csv') and place the dataset in your working directory
-Make sure the following libraries are installed:     
   pandas
   numpy
   matplotlib
   seaborn
   scikit-learn
   imbalanced-learn
   mlxtend
-Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed in the same environment.

When executed successfully the code should generate:
-Classification reports for three machine learning models.
-AUC-ROC scores, F1 scores, and accuracy metrics for the three models
-Heatmaps of confusion matrices for Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and KNN classifiers.
=Visualizations for data exploration and model evaluation.
